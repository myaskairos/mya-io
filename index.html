        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I was born in Detroit, Michigan. I met the love of my life in high school and now we have two beautiful children. We were blessed with the perfect pair; a boy and a girl. I got my first tech job as a Software QA and fell in love with it. My goal is to learn more programming language and either become a software engineer or a well versed tester. My brain is always searching for more things to learn and I've no choice but to feed the beast! </p>
        <ul class="facts">Fun facts!
          <li>My favorite book is "The invention of Hugo Cabret" but it's a close tie with "To Kill A Mockingbird". </li>
          <li> I love swimming and pretty much getting into any form of water. If I could choose any place to be the answer will always be near the water. </li>
